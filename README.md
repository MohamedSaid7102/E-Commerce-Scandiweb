## Entry React developer TEST

## V1.0

## Things I added:

- Blurred transparent navbar.
- Bottom border for dropdown cart items.

## Notes

- To enable attribute select in cart dropdown & cart 'checkout' just make `disableAttributeChange={false}` in `<CartItem/>` component in both `<Cart />` and `<CartDropdown/>` Components.

## Things I added:

- Removed some images from the product that contains the girl image, For Religious purposes, I'm a Muslim and we as Muslims are not allowed to look at some parts of women's body, because they are our jewels hence we treat them like queens in Islam, and that is applied to any women either Muslim or not, my mom or wife or sister or not,
  I hope you can understand that with open arms.

### Style:

Instead of dividing style into multiple style sheets, I mad basic general styles into `index.css` and app style inside `app.css`, I divided the style sheet by component, If you are looking for the `<Hello />` component style you will find it in the `app.css` between:

```
// Hello Start

{
  // Style...
}

// Hello End
```

and included responsiveness as a sepert file
so remember to search with the component name for easy access.
