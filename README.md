## Notes ðŸ—’

### Style:

Instead of dividing style into multiple style sheets, I mad basic general styles into `index.css` and app style inside `app.css`, I divided the style sheet by component, If you are looking for the `<Hello />` component style you will find it in the `app.css` between:

```
// Hello Start

{
  // Style...
}

// Hello End
```
and included responsiveness as a sepert file
so remember to search with the component name for easy access.
